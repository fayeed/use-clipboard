### `useClipboard(options: UseClipboardProps): useClipboardReturnType`

#### `UseClipboardProps`

* `onSuccess` - It's a callback function that is called after the `copy` or `cut` command is executed.
* `onError` - Triggers when the hook encounters an error. If passed hook won't throw an error.
* `disableClipboardAPI` - Disables the new clipboard API `navigator.clipboard` even if it is supported.
* `copiedDuration` - Revert back the isCopied flag to false again if a value is set.

#### `useClipboardReturnType`

* `ref` - Use ref to pull the text content from.
* `copy` - Used to perform the copy operation.
* `cut` - Used to perform the cut operation.
* `isCoppied` - Indicates wheater the content was successfully copied or not.
* `clipboard` - Current selected clipboard content.
* `clearClipboard` - Clears the user clipboard.
* `isSupported` - Check to see if the browser supports the new `navigator.clipboard` API.
